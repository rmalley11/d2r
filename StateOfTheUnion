Accomplished Thus Far :

Decided to use JSON for file formatting. 
Found driver that converts DHT output into readable text
Wired circuit using an RPi breakout board to hook up temp sensor to RPi.
Recieved understandable readings from DHT22 being sent to RPi.

Changed :

Went into more depth on the inner working of each device.
Researched manchester encoding and microcontroller before using the Pi.

To Do:

Send temperature signal through a network.
Store data in a file format such as JSON.
