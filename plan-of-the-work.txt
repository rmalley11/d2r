Plan of the Work

GOAL: Gather temperature data and transmit it over a network to be
      stored on a server for display and analysis.

RESOURCES:

    hardware

	dht22	temperature and humidity sensor
			vendor:
			datasheet:

	rpi	raspberry pi
			homepage:

	misc	keyboard, mouse, monitor
			generic components on hand

    software

	debian/arm	OS for rpi
	libdht22	originally for arduino
	python		scripting language for rpi
	d2r		dht22 to rpi scripts

    infrastructure

	LAN		wired lan for rpi network interface
	host		mac or linux host with python


PROJECT ROADMAP:

	read temp
	feed data to rpi
	upload data through network
	store data offsite

PROJECT SCHEDULE:
	
1. acquire hardware (DONE)

2. learn to read data from dht22 (DONE)

2.5

	man pages
	data formats on the wire
		html GET or PUT
		RESTful interface
		protocol buffers
		json/xml/ec
		SQL to a DB (mysql or postgresql)
	data formats in memory
		just work with the string
		parse to a structure
	data formats on disk

3. define software  (week of feb 10)

	- service name d2r
	- locations of files and directories
	- data formats
		- in files
		- in memory
		- on the wire
	- keep reference list

    deliverables
	- printout of reference list
	- source to man page for the executables
		can be combined if two pager
	- source to man page for the data formats
	- printouts of all man pages

	- comments, questions, in log book

4. create testing framework (week of Feb 17)

	- write and document example file formats
	- scripted data generators, parsers, validators

    deliverables
	- project binder
	- project folder
	- project archive
	- source to man pages for all programs
	- source to man pages for all formats
	- printouts of all man pages
	- comments, questions, in log book
	- printout of new reference list entries

5. data acquisition code (week of feb 24)
	- schematic, bom, layout (with picture)
	- spec
	- code
	- validate

6. data transmission code (week of apr 7)
	- spec
	- code
	- validate

7. data storage code (week of apr 14)
	- spec

	- validate

8. data display code (week of apr 21)
	- spec
	- code
	- validate

9. system integration (week of may 4)
	- validation     "Are you building the right thing?"
	- verification	 "Are you building it right?"
	- acceptance

10. project report & webpage (week of may 11)
