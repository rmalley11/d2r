.SH NAME

d2r_DataValid

.SH SYNOPSIS

d2r_DataValid \- 

.SH DESCRIPTION

Validates data sent from either a generator or actual output from a temperature sensor. Data is validated in several different aspects. The temperature is checked to make sure it outputs a temperature between -50 C and 80 C as that is the minimum and maximum temperature allowed by the sensor, though for practical reasons those temperatures may be reduced to a more reasonable gauge seeing as how the circuit measures room temperatures. The humidity should also be a number between 1-100.The time is also checked to make sure it comes after the previous recorded time but no more than 2 or 3 seconds after. Any variance in these conditions will lead to removal of the data from the structure as a whole.
